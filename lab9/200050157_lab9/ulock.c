    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60497547/why-do-we-need-pushcli-before-xchg
    // xchg ensures atomicity between threads, but interrupt handlers are still a problem.
    // ** see SO link -- e.g. if this thread has acquired lock (and not released),
    // and interrupt occurs, and interrupt handler wants this lock => it will be stuck in 
    // the while loop, and by definition an interrupt handler must be executed until 
    // its end before the CPU can continue doing anything else.
    // => need to restart system

    // but here, we're just using the locks in testcases -- so mp interrupt handler
    // won't try to acquire this lock...

    // pushcli(); // disable interrupts to avoid deadlock.          // panic: sched locks
                                                                    // grep -rnw 'sched locks' .

    // The xchg is atomic.
    while(xchg(&(s->locked), 1) != 0);     // my: like in theory quiz-2,
                                        // returns prev value of s->locked
                                        // (and sets it to 1) -- so if it's 1 already,
                                        // sets it to 1_new(=1) and returns 1_prev
                                        // then we know that lock is already held...
