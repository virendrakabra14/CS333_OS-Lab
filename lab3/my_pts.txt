fork-exec model:

This function will give the control of the current process (C program) to the command. So, the C program is instantly replaced with the actual command.

So, anything that comes after execvp() will NOT execute, since our program is taken over completely!

However, if the command fails for some reason, execvp() will return -1.

So, whenever you use execvp(), if you want to maintain your C program, you generally use fork() to first spawn a new process, and then use execvp() on that new process.

This is called the “fork-exec” model, and is the standard practice for running multiple processes using C.
